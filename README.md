#Overview
The Population Explorer is a simple JavaScript library that facilitates the real-time exploration of data sets using an intuitive user interface. The tool was designed to empower researchers to explore their medical research data in real time. A simple example of the tool is shown below; a live, interactive version can be found [here](http://bl.ocks.org/jwildfire/raw/82b1fbf001c50c4edde4/).

Once the page loads, users choose a "Subpopulation" of interest (e.g. a particular study site) or use the default settings to look across the whole population. Next, they define characteristics of interest to generate real-time rates. Both the rates and subpopulations can be updated in real time. This simple tool allows for surprisingly complex queries and facilitates data exploration, data cleaning and hypothesis generation. See the Basic Explorer example for an example using real data. For technical details and an explanation of how to create a population explorer of your own, see the User Guide.
